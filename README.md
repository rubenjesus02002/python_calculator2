# **Course Project #1 – Python Average Calculator 2**

This is version 2 of the "Python Calculator 1" project I have hosted on my repositories. The main goal in recreating this project was to further grasp the fundamentals of using Git and Github, this time on a team oriented project. The task is to build a Python program to practice core programming concepts and gain hands‑on experience with Git and GitHub workflows. I have decided to tackle this project to strengthen my skills in functions, loops, and unit testing. 

## **Features**
Prompts the user for three integers (positive, negative, or zero)

Calculates the average (with decimals) of the three values

Compares each number to the average (above, below, or equal)

Loops until a special input ends the program and outputs the total sets processed

Includes unit tests for all major functions

## **Tools & Environment**
Language: Python 3.x

Testing: pytest or Python unittest

Version Control: Git + GitHub

## **How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program:
   python main.py
4. Run the tests:
   python3 -m pytest "example test_introduction.py" (Run specific test)
   or
   python3 -m pytest -v (Run all tests in verbose mode - 4 total tests) 

## **Lessons Learned:**
- Implemented Python logic and learned how to effectively use unit tests. 

- Gained hands‑on experience with Git (commits, branches, pushing to GitHub).

- Focused my approach more on project management, and collaboration.

- Built an understanding of the project workflow using Git and how to handle merge errors.
